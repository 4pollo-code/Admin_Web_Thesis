# Frontend React Application

This is the frontend part of the fullstack application built with React.js. It serves as the user interface for the application, interacting with the backend API built with Flask.

## Project Structure

- `public/index.html`: The main HTML file that serves as the entry point for the React application.
- `src/App.js`: The main component that defines the structure and behavior of the application.
- `src/index.js`: The entry point for the React application, rendering the `App` component into the DOM.
- `src/components/ExampleComponent.js`: An example React component that can be used within the application.

## Getting Started

To get started with the frontend application, follow these steps:

1. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the `frontend` directory and run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the Application**: After installing the dependencies, you can start the development server with:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

3. **Open in Browser**: Once the server is running, open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.
